# Phonebook_Management_System

Problem Statement

To develop a phonebook management system using C programming. It should be able to add, delete, modify, and search contacts from the system.

Description

Phonebook management system is a simple system in which we can save Contacts the same way how we do in our mobile phones. It is an application without graphics, and it is compiled in the code blocks with GCC compiler. Basic concepts of C like function, structures are used in this program.

Management system is useful because it can sort and make it easier to search any contacts in the list. Personal information like full name, mobile number, address, email ID, gender and many other details can be added to the record of the phone book. All these Contacts once saved can be modified, searched, listed, and remove from the application.

The homepage of the program will have basic functions of a phone book such as

Add contact: New contact can be added with this.It will collect details like name, mobile number, email ID, address, and gender.

List all Contacts: This will display all the Contacts that are stored in the database along with their details.

Search Contacts: Contacts can be searched based on their names or phone number.

Edit Contacts: We can edit the information of the Contacts such as name, phone number, address, or email ID.

Delete Contacts: This deletes the Contacts from the database.
